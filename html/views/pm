Subject:- Request to stop the corruption in private jobs
Respected Sir,
	I want to tell that in the Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Allahabad located in Jhalwa, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, the 183 security guards, that are serving here for the last 10 years, were initially paid Rs 1953 and afterwards it was increased to Rs 3600, along with two monthly holidays. Again, it was increased to Rs 9000, and two monthly holidays were allowed.Then, it was further increased to Rs 17000 , along with 4 holidays. PF was also deducted.And after the change of security in 2018, we are not being provided the money for the 4 monthly holidays, and so we need to take 4 holidays on our own. Also, we are not getting any PF in our banks as it was shown on our mobiles.The amount that we are getting now is even lesser than the amount that we used to get before.We want to know whether in the time of costliness, our salaries should be increased or decreased.
			Please take concrete steps in this regard.We kindly request you to look into the matter, and help the 183 security guards.
	Thanking You.
	183 Securtity guards of IIIT Allahabad.
